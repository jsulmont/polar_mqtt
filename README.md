### Common Requirements
- Rust toolchain (stable)
- CMake (3.1 or higher)

```

### Linux Arch Linux (requires AUR/yay)

## Building

This project uses Cargo with a custom build script (`build.rs`) to handle the C++ dependencies.

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/jsulmont/rs-polar-mqtt
cd rs-polar-mqtt

# Build the project
cargo build
```

## Running the examples

There are currently 3 [examples](examples) which you should be able to run with crgo as usual:

```bash
cargo run --example mosquito_org

```
Note that `mosquito_org` will only work if `test.mosquitto.org` listen to port `1883` (it's sometime down).
